![ItchICoverWhaleTale](https://github.com/Patch4Code/TheWhaleTale/assets/116561421/6267d28e-5994-4895-aa61-e9fdca0b1b1f)

- This is a game prototype for a 2d platformer adventure game made with Godot 4
- The game was developed as part of the game design course in my studies together with [@joaoo97](https://github.com/joaoo97) and [@MichiJudge](https://github.com/MichiJudge)
- The game language is German and it is playable on Windows or Mac and also as a browser game

#### Premise
- You have been swallowed by a huge whale and must now find a way to escape back to freedom unharmed. 
In this strange environment made up of all kinds of swallowed objects, such as entire ships, you now 
have to embark on an adventure through the whale's body and unravel all kinds of mysteries and secrets.

- The game builds up on the events that previously took place in a test with a paper prototype.
